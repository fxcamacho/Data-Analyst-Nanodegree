    ">One of the most shocking thing that I discovered is that the info from some keys are added in different language, in this dataset: Spanish and English. I can easily prove this having a look in the postal code key of ways_tags table. I downloaded the map of postal codes for Madrid region and I can ensure that all postal code in this area have a length of 5 characters and start with \"28XXX\". This can be checked in the following link: http://www.madrid.org/iestadis/fijas/estructu/general/territorio/descarga/cpos.pdf\n",

They will have the possibility to remove or accept what the standard users have propose to change. \n",

    "><li>Define a standarised way of working between the contributors for adding information to OpenStreetMap.\n",
    "><li>Data accuracy will improve as it is understood taht the master users will use the same criteria for completing the maps.\n",
    "><li>Improvements in keys categorization based in the experience of the master users which will be able to identify quicker the categorization issues of the elements.\n",

The master users should be trusted users because they will have the responsability to provide truthful information to the user which probably is one of the most important thing for OpenStreetMap. If the users cannot find reliable info, the project would have no value.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Another relevant topic to deal is the periodicity of the reviews, the master user role should demand a considerable activity of the master users in order to attend the modification requests from other standard users. If the request are put in a never ending queue or never be attended it will no see any improvement in the data quality for the maps. \n",
    "A potential solution to easily identify how valuable is a user it could be to introduce a user rating accesible to everyone in the same way than it is done in other platforms like Amazon or forums. I think this implementation would show information about the most valuable users who highly contribution to the development of the project.\n",

This ranking could be elaborated measuring the number of contributions and also the rating provided by other users. The monthly basis review should be the lure for a actively contribution by the master users if they don't want to lose rights for modifying information over their favourites places."

Nevertheless, completeness of the file is quite good as we can find a lot of details about what can be found in the city.\n",
